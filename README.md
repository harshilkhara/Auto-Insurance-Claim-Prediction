# Auto-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Here the dataset of an auto insurance company is taken for analysis. We analyze the data on various data fields such as credit score, size of family, vehicle type and visualize the patterns in the process. This research can answer the questions like which customer is more likely to claim an insurance in the future and which customer would not be able to claim the insurance given the credit score. It will help the insurance company to get an insight of their customer’s insurance needs and they can further modify their insurance policy such that they both profit from it. Further the research can also provide an insight on which vehicle type the insurance was claimed the most. Finally, the research scenario will use data science and machine learning models to classify the data and come to a certain conclusion which can be used by the company to forecast the insurance claims of their customer and further build a strategy for the same.
After using different machine learning models like KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine we found KNN has best accuracy rate with 73.12% for our given data.
Notably, Decision tree has second best accuracy with 71.37%.
Therefore, using K nearest Neighbor algorithm the company can predict which customer is more likely to claim the insurance.
